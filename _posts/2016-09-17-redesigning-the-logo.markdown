One part of Positly that's been needing a rework for a while is the logo. 

![Current Positly Logo]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/icon-updates/icon-80.png)

It doesn't do a good job of explaining the site, isn't very memorable and most of all is very similar to the podcast icon. It's filled in nicely as a placeholder but it's time for it to be replaced. One of the big problems is that the term opinion doesn't bring much iconography to mind so it's hard to find someone who can quickly solve this problem for me.

The first attempt - Fiverr

Did you know you can get a company logo for just $5 on [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/) ? Sounds too good to be true and unsurprisingly it is. But at that low price I had to give it a try. I figured even if I didn't get something great it might help me come up with some of my own ideas. I chose someone who offered to give me 3 options before I chose my logo.

The first was fairly generic but looked nice. A quick reverse image search revealed that it was stolen directly from a site called [community scene](http://community-scene.com/). Not only was the logo already in use but it was also trademarked. I asked for something which tied more to my brand and wasn't trademarked.

The second was a bit closer to my brand. Though I think quotes relate better to a discussion opposed to opinions. This logo wasn't trademarked but was already in use by an android app and available on stock images which would make it a bad choice for my logo. After this the user told me he didn't have any more ideas and cancelled the order. Which I think means he realised that I wasn't going to buy a stolen logo so he might as well move on to another chump. Now I've got $5 Fiverr credit. Anyone know something you can get on fiverr that isn't a scam?

The second attempt - Going solo

With the dream of getting a cheap logo gone I decided to try to create one myself. I wanted the logo to be simple so it shouldn't be outside my drawing abilities anyway. I started with some brainstorming to fill in the gaps of what it should look like:

![Brainstorming]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/icon-updates/brainstorming.jpg)

After the brainstorming I settled on the bubble style exclamation marks going in a circle. The exclamation mark is the best piece of iconography I can think of representing opinions and putting it in a circle makes them look a bit like people which represents peoples opinions.

With a good looking idea in my hand I got to turning it into a nice graphic. Unlink a normal person I decided to try my hand at describing as as sequence of functions. Unfortunately the maths got too tricky and it turned into a huge time sink. I then turned to vectorisation. I simply took a photo of the image and put it through some vectorisation to simplify it then rotated a single piece 3 times to make the logo.

This gave a fairly good idea of what I wanted but the individual shape was a little bit lumpy. Luckily my girlfriend had simultaneously started drawing a better version. With this replaced the logo looked pretty good. I ended up opting for a 5 point logo instead of the planned 3 as it felt less sparse.

Unfortunately while I like this logo it is terrible at lower resolutions. So I replaced the 5 with 2 to allow the individual parts to be bigger

Final thoughts

I think the process turned out pretty well. It's probably not that much better at explaining what positly is but it feels more unique. There's a lot of room to move around with the logo if I decide to change it but can keep the core concept.
